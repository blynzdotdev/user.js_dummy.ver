# user.js_dummy.ver
Arkenfox's secure user.js, compiled, with a good override list. Brewed for use out of the box

[the first release isnt out yet, this repo isnt functional just yet]

Hi, i am Blynz.
I make this repo, because i found the orginal very confusing and unfriendly for beginners.
This repo aims to provide a complete and useful experience out of the box.

The user.js, prefcleaner, and updater are the work of ArkenFox. (original here: https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js)
I just wrote a good user-overrides.js and a installation guide that is easier to understand than theirs.
